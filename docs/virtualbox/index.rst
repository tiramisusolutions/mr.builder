Introduction
============

To make it easier for anyone to review or evaluate `Plone <https://plone.com>`_, we provide this **VirtualBox Plone Appliance**.

It is a self-contained appliance that will run independent from your current operating system.
So you don't have to go to separate install steps. 

Do note that this is **not** meant for production environments.

The only application you need is `Virtualbox <https://www.virtualbox.org>`_.

===========

Please make sure that you have `Virtualbox <https://www.virtualbox.org>`_ installed.

Mac OS X
---------

If you do not have `Virtualbox <https://www.virtualbox.org>`_ installed, please `download <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>`_ VirtualBox for OS X hosts.
