A Mature Solution
-----------------

Plone is among the top 2% of all open source projects worldwide. It has had over 89,000 commits made by close to 800 code contributors, representing close to 1,250,000 lines of code. This is the equivalent of an estimated 350 years of effort. Plone is supported by more than 300 solution providers in 57 countries. The project has been actively developed since 2002, is available in more than 40 languages, and has the best security track record of any major CMS.

Protected by a Foundation
-------------------------
Plone is governed by the Plone Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that was formed in May 2004 to serve as a supporting organization for the CMS and its community. The Foundation provides support for development and marketing, and is modeled after similar ventures such as the Apache Software Foundation. It is the legal owner of the Plone codebase, trademarks, and domain names. The Foundation's goal is to ensure that Plone remains the premier open source content management system and that the community broadens its acceptance and visibility.
